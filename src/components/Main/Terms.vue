Users of the Whavit Platform contract for Professional Services directly with other Users. Whavit is not a party to any contracts for Professional Services. The Whavit Platform facilitates these contracts by supplying a medium through which Requesters can connect with Professionals, schedule certain Professional Services, and make payments for certain Professional Services (</span><strong><span style="font-family:Nunito;">"Payments"</span></strong><span style="font-family:Nunito;">). Requesters are obligated to pay in advance for those Professional Services and/or Merchandise they order through the Whavit Platform. Prior to the scheduled Professional Service, we will charge the Requester's credit card according to the amount the Requester has agreed to on the Whavit Platform with respect to those Professional Services and/or Merchandise, the Requester has ordered, and for all purchases and payments for reimbursement costs, fees, expenses or applicable taxes associated with a Professional Service as well as the Trust and Support Fee (as defined in 3(f) below), and the Requester hereby authorizes us to charge the credit card on file in the Requester's Whavit Platform account for such amounts. We will use third party services to process credit card information. By accepting this Agreement, you are giving Whavit (or a third-party payment processor on Whavit's behalf) permission to charge your on-file credit card, debit card, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you owe Whavit. Depending on the transaction you selected or services requested, Whavit may charge you on a one-time or recurring basis. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Professional Services must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with Whavit at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to place a hold on the Requester's credit card for an ordered or completed Professional Service transaction. Seventy-two (72) hours after a Professional Service is completed, if there is no complaint by the Requester, we will mark the Professional Service as closed. If the Requester has agreed with the Professional to extend or reduce the hours in or to reschedule a requested Professional Service, the Requester bears the responsibility for notifying Whavit. Requesters must notify Whavit either by changing the date or hours of the requested Professional Service through the Whavit Platform or by visiting the Whavit Help Center at</span><span style="font-family:Nunito;">&nbsp;</span>

Except for Professional Services that are requested through Home Improvement Referrals, all Payments by Requesters must be made through the Whavit Platform. Any Professional Services that are requested through Home Improvement Referrals, any Payments paid, or any Professional Services scheduled or obtained outside of the Whavit Platform are not subject to our Whavit Happiness Guarantee in Section 3(d). Except for the Whavit Happiness Guarantee in Section 3(d), and the Refund Policy in Section 3(e), no refunds or credits will be provided once the Requester's credit card has been charged, except that at our sole discretion, refunds or credits may be granted in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific promotions, or to correct any errors we have made. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any damage that may result should any information be released to any third parties, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. Requesters will be liable for all transaction taxes on the Professional Service(s) provided (other than taxes based on Whavit's income). If we determine that your actions or performance may result in returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations of our terms or policies, or other risks to Whavit or third parties, then Whavit may withhold any payments to you for as long as we determine any related risks to Whavit or third parties persist. For any amounts that we determine you owe us, we may (i) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you or amounts we may owe you; (ii) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt; (iii) reverse any credits to your bank account; or (iv) collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or to repeatedly violate this Agreement, then we may in our sole discretion permanently withhold any payments to you.</span></p>

This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and evidences a transaction involving commerce. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the FAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If you are unable to pay such costs, Whavit will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. Each party will pay the fees for his/her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing. Additionally, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement.

The arbitrator is without authority to apply any different substantive law. The parties have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any dispute in this regard shall be decided by the arbitrator. The location of the arbitration proceeding shall take place in the city or county where you reside, unless each party agrees otherwise.
